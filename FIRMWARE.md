Ubuntu Touch for surya is based on Halium 10 and Android 10 Ubuntu Touch rootfs so it requires an Android 10 base firmware before it can be flashed on your phone.
While custom ROMs like LineageOS 17.1 might work, they are untested and not recommended. Instead, use the MIUI Android 10 based firmware, with specific version recommended in the Ubuntu Touch surya page.
